        <p>A lot of collectors view the first half of the 90’s as the ‘classic’ era for mountain bikes. The industry had moved past the awkward 80s of upright bikes cobbled together from a mix of road and motocross parts, and the focus was on light and elegant cross country focused bikes, with short travel front suspension only. Steel was still the only affordable material, but it was at a peak of its evolution, which excellent tubing and skilled fabrication. Basically the cross country hardtail became super refined in this era. Downhill specific and full suspension bikes were still a rarity and were still informed by that elegant cross country/lightweight aesthetic.</p>
        <p>Then toward the end of the decade a few things happened. Aluminum became cost effective at lower price points - and with it more experimentation with frame shapes and designs - monocoque frames, extruded shapes instead of round tubes, crazy oversized members, etc. Combined with the fat caterpillar welds of aluminum, the thin elegant look of a traditional steel (or titanium) frame went out the window.
        </p>
        <p>At the same time full suspension became more mainstream, but it was still a free for all of designers cooking up crazy contraptions to deliver that rear travel. Most of those were dumb, but people were literally throwing shit at the wall to see what would stick.
        </p>
        <p>Thirdly, I think there was a bit of a reaction against the gracile, light at all costs aesthetic of the first half of the decade, and the fashion shifted to a more beefy, motocross inspired look. People were tired of super light parts breaking under the weight of regular joe riders, not skinny racers, and wanted parts that looked bombproof, not light. This included adopting loud (frankly tacky) motocross inspired graphics and color schemes to enhance the impression of toughness.</p>
        <p>It all combined to produce some of the ugliest, weirdest looking bikes ever. In summary: people wanted suspension, but manufacturers had no consensus on how to design that. Aluminum was available now at a low price but manufacturers had no consensus on how to design that. And people wanted bikes that looked ‘tough’, and different from the elegant look of the previous style - literally ‘ugly was better’.</p>
